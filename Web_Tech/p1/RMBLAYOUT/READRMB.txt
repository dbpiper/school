The top-level html files are a simple demo of the progression from 
a box model using float/clear, through flexbox, and on to grid; at 
least one also shows flexbox used with grid:

    bxx.html  box model prior to flexbox
    fxx.html  flexbox model
    gxx.html  grid ; the last one combines grid with flexbox

The sub-directories are additional examples of each of the models
and gridSlides contains a few slides introducing the grid model.
